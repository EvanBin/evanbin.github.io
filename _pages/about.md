I am currently a PhD candidate in the **[IMCL](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~labimcl/index.html)** Group supervised by **[Prof. CAO Jiannong](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/)** with the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). Before that, I received the B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Northeastern University in 2020, and M.Sc. degree in Technology Innovation from the University of Washington in 2022. 

I’m broadly interested in blockchain technology in Web 3.0. Currently, I’m focusing on the topics listed below:

📖 **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**

📖 **Blockchain Oracle**

📖 **Real-World-Asset (RWA) Verification**
